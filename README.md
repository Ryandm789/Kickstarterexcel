# Kickstarting with Excel
The purpose of the Kick Start challenge was to ensure that students could navigate throughout excel performing functions highlighting data. Obtaining the concept of Excel will lead you into future success when it comes to being a data/business analyst. 


## Overview of Project
The Kick Starter challenge was geared to assist Louise in raising for a campaign and she has a budget that she has to maintain. Executing the detailed instructions provided through canvas, I was able to highlight the area of Percentage Fund, Average Donation through Excel. Also, I highlighted the Goals, Pledges with the according failed, canceled, successful, live outcomes throughout this campaign.  


### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to highlight all the big data present from the Kick Starter data to paint a picture of where Louise is at for the campaign. Using Excel highlighting the data will help Louise understand where her budget is at within her campaign. 


## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis represent a ton of successful outcomes from the goals and pledges being met throughout this project according to the data. Most failed outcomes according to the data failed because a substantial less amount being pledged for a successful outcome had no didn't meet the goal or had $0.00 being pledged.  


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Outcomes based on Launch dates stemming from 2009-2017, with the sum becoming better over the years reaching the goal of the campaign. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The overall view of this data highlighted that successful and was much more on in the targeted area of reaching the goal. The successful outcome out performed failed, live, and canceled by a substantial more revenue generated than the other outcomes listed. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I found it extremely challenging throughout the module trying to learn a new tool with little guidelines in areas that were vital to successfully execute this project. Understanding what is expected with specific details on projects would be beneficial.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
The conclusions drawn base on the outcomes and launch data highlight more successful goals being met over the years. The goals and pledges become more successful over time and Louise will see that data being presented. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 
The overall view of this data highlighted that successful and was much more on in the targeted area of reaching the goal. The successful outcome out performed failed, live, and canceled by a substantial more revenue generated than the other outcomes listed. 


- What are some limitations of this dataset? N/A

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? We could have presented histograms with outliers and pie charts to a certain degree with how effective the outcomes were or not.
